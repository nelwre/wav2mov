# wav2mov

# What Is That?

* It's a bash script that converts any .wav file into a "black screen" .mov file.

# How do I use it?

* you just need a .wav file (obviously) and ffmpeg installed.

* After Downloading the shell script, you can execute it from:

* "bash wav2mov.sh filename.wav"

* Then, ffmpeg renders a black color screen in the exact duration of the audio, at 720p30fps.

# But why?

* I made this with the intention of uploading the pure audio, to avoid possible loss of quality when uploaded to some video services (YouTube is a good example because it always re-encodes audios from videos to aac or opus).

* Unfortunately, there is no way to prevent this, so the best way is to upload the pure audio to avoid loss of quality "in what is already lost".
